    My name is Bi Qiuyu. I was born in Jiangsu province, China in 1999. During my undergraduate, I studied computer science and technology at Nanjing University. In school, I participated in many competitions, including MCM, vivo hackathon and so on. Won the third prize of college students' knowledge contest. At the same time, I served as the minister of Practice department in the Student Union of Computer department and the head of Education department in our school's go club.
